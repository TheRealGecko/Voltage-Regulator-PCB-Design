# Voltage Regulator PCB Design

I designed a custom low-dropout voltage regulator PCB in Altium Designer for the WARG design team onboarding challenge. Below are the schematic and layout of my design.

Process included:
- Selecting appropriate components
- Designing the schematic in Altium
- Routing and placing components on the PCB layout
- Iterating and refining the design based on feedback
